    "Remember we take the mean of the set K closest to get the approximate value of y we are looking for\n",
    "Good for fitting the data, but there are horizontal lines at the ends\n",

    "\n",
    "3. What happens when k varies\n",
    "If we use the average of every value of y (Or K = N), we end up with a straight line\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use K = 1, we are going to pretty much match the data we we given since there is nothing to average\n",

    "As we increase K we are less and less likely to overfit\n",

    "4. What happens as D varies (polynomials)\n",
    "As we increase D (our degree of polynomial) we are more likely to overfit\n",
    "Good thing (vs KNN) is that as we go off of the edge of the model, we are able to extrapolate, this is not the case in KNN\n",

    "This is the out of sample error, which is found by finding the error for the test data.\n",
